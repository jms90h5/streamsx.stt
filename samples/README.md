## Sample Architecture

```spl
// Audio input from file
stream<blob audioChunk, uint64 audioTimestamp> AudioStream = FileAudioSource() {
    param
        filename: "/absolute/path/to/audio.wav";
        blockSize: 16384u;
        sampleRate: 16000;
}

// NeMo speech recognition  
stream<rstring transcription> Transcription = NeMoSTT(AudioStream) {
    param
        modelPath: "/absolute/path/to/model.onnx";
        audioFormat: mono16k;
}

// Display and save results
() as Display = Custom(Transcription) {
    logic onTuple Transcription: {
        printStringLn("Transcription: " + transcription);
    }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Interface Library Pattern
- **Problem**: ONNX Runtime headers contain C++17 `noexcept` keyword incompatible with Streams compiler
- **Solution**: Interface library (`libnemo_ctc_interface.so`) isolates ONNX headers from SPL compilation
- **Result**: Clean compilation and successful execution

### Key Components
- `NeMoCTCInterface.hpp`: Pure virtual interface
- `NeMoCTCInterface.cpp`: Factory implementation with ONNX dependencies
- `impl/lib/libnemo_ctc_interface.so`: Built library containing implementation

## Processing Modes Explained

### Real-time Mode (`realtimePlayback="true"`)
- **Purpose**: Simulates live audio streaming scenarios
- **Behavior**: Processes chunks at the rate audio would arrive in real-time
- **Use Cases**: Testing streaming applications, live transcription demos
- **Performance**: Wall time ≈ Audio duration
- **Example**: 10s of audio takes ~10s to process

### Full Speed Mode (`realtimePlayback="false"`)
- **Purpose**: Maximum throughput for batch processing
- **Behavior**: Processes chunks as fast as possible
- **Use Cases**: Transcribing pre-recorded files, batch analytics
- **Performance**: 8-14x faster than real-time
- **Example**: 120s of audio processes in ~8-14s

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"STREAMS_JAVA_HOME is not set"**
```bash
source /path/to/streams/7.2.0.0/bin/streamsprofile.sh
```

**"libnemo_ctc_interface.so: cannot open shared object file"**
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/streamsx.stt/deps/onnxruntime/lib:/path/to/streamsx.stt/deps/kaldi-native-fbank/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**"An operator was attempting to access the data directory"**
```bash
./bin/standalone --data-directory=data
```

**"Model file not found"**
- Use absolute paths in SPL files
- Verify model exists: `ls -la ../models/fastconformer_ctc_export/`

**"undefined symbol" errors**
- Rebuild interface library: `cd ../impl && make -f Makefile.nemo_interface`
- Regenerate toolkit: `cd .. && spl-make-toolkit -i . --no-mixed-mode -m`

### Debug Mode
```bash
export STREAMS_LOG_LEVEL=debug
./bin/standalone --data-directory=data
```

## Creating New Samples

Use BasicNeMoDemo as template:
1. Copy SPL structure
2. Update audio file paths
3. Modify model paths as needed
4. Add to samples/Makefile

## Performance

- **Model**: FastConformer CTC (114M parameters)
- **Processing**: Real-time capable 
- **Memory**: ~200MB during inference
- **Accuracy**: Production-grade English speech recognition

## Requirements

- Teracloud Streams 7.2.0+
- NeMo FastConformer CTC model (exported to ONNX)
- Test audio files (16kHz, mono, WAV format)
- Built interface library and toolkit
