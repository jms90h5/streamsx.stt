# NVIDIA NeMo Cache-Aware Streaming FastConformer Implementation

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This document describes the complex RNNT approach that was replaced by a simpler, working CTC solution.

**Please see:**
- **CORRECT_ONNX_EXPORT_PROCESS.md** - The solution that actually works
- **NEMO_CTC_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Current successful implementation

## Overview (Historical)

This document previously described a cache-aware streaming FastConformer implementation using hybrid RNNT-CTC export. This approach was found to be overly complex and was replaced with a simpler CTC-only export that provides better results.

## Model Details

**Model**: `nvidia/stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_multi`
- **Architecture**: Cache-aware FastConformer with 114M parameters
- **Encoder**: 17-layer FastConformer (512 d_model, 8 attention heads)
- **Decoders**: Hybrid CTC + RNN-T for optimal accuracy and speed
- **Training Data**: 13 datasets including LibriSpeech, Fisher Corpus, Switchboard, Mozilla Common Voice
- **Performance**: WER 5.4% - 8.4% depending on latency setting

## Key Advantages Over WeNet

### 1. **Cache-Aware Streaming**
- Maintains consistent predictions between offline and streaming modes
- Efficient memory usage through intelligent caching of encoder states
- No computation duplication across streaming chunks

### 2. **Multi-Latency Support**
- **Ultra Low (0ms)**: Fully causal, real-time processing
- **Very Low (80ms)**: Minimal look-ahead for low-latency applications  
- **Low (480ms)**: Standard latency with good accuracy
- **Medium (1040ms)**: Extended context for maximum accuracy

### 3. **Hybrid Decoder Architecture**
- **CTC Decoder**: Fast streaming inference with immediate results
- **RNN-T Decoder**: Higher accuracy for final transcriptions
- **Hybrid Mode**: Intelligent switching between decoders based on context

### 4. **Advanced Training**
- Trained on much larger dataset (multiple thousands of hours vs LibriSpeech's 960 hours)
- Multitask training with joint CTC and RNN-T losses
- Chunked attention mechanism optimized for streaming

## Implementation Architecture

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Modes
| Mode | Latency | Chunk Size | Use Case |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ultra Low | 0ms | 160 samples (~10ms) | Real-time voice commands |
| Very Low | 80ms | 1280 samples | Interactive applications |

| Medium | 1040ms | 16640 samples | High-accuracy transcription |

### Processing Performance
- **Real-time Factor**: >1.0x (faster than real-time)
- **Memory Usage**: ~100MB base + ~10MB cache per stream
- **Accuracy**: Matches offline performance in streaming mode
- **Latency**: User-configurable from 0ms to 1040ms

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create cache-aware streaming model
auto model = createNeMoCacheAwareModel(".", 
                                     NeMoCacheAwareStreaming::LatencyMode::LOW,
                                     NeMoCacheAwareStreaming::DecoderType::CTC);

// Process streaming audio
std::string result = model->processAudioChunk(audio_data, chunk_size, false);

// Change latency mode dynamically
model->setLatencyMode(NeMoCacheAwareStreaming::LatencyMode::ULTRA_LOW);

// Switch decoder types
model->setDecoderType(NeMoCacheAwareStreaming::DecoderType::HYBRID);
```

## Integration with IBM Streams

The implementation follows the existing `ModelInterface` pattern and can be seamlessly integrated with:

- **SPL Operators**: Compatible with existing `OnnxSTT` operator framework
- **Streams Runtime**: Processes audio tuples in real-time
- **Configuration**: Runtime configuration of latency and decoder modes
- **Metrics**: Built-in performance monitoring and statistics

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests with:
```bash
make test-nemo-cache-aware
```

Tests include:
- Multi-latency mode comparison
- Decoder type benchmarking  
- Real-time processing verification
- Cache efficiency validation
- Memory usage monitoring

## Future Enhancements

2. **Beam Search**: Advanced RNN-T decoding with beam search
3. **Multi-GPU**: Parallel processing for multiple streams
4. **Language Models**: Integration with external LMs for better accuracy
5. **Adaptive Streaming**: Dynamic latency adjustment based on network conditions

## Conclusion [DEPRECATED]

**This approach was abandoned in favor of the simpler CTC export method.**

The cache-aware RNNT implementation described in this document was found to be overly complex. The attempted ONNX export of the hybrid model failed due to:
- Complex dual-decoder architecture not suitable for ONNX
- Cache management complexity in C++
- Unnecessary overhead for streaming applications

**Current Solution**: We discovered that exporting the same model with CTC-only decoder works perfectly and provides excellent results with much simpler implementation. See:
- `CORRECT_ONNX_EXPORT_PROCESS.md` - How we discovered the solution
- `NEMO_CTC_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Current working implementation
- `export_model_ctc.py` - Working export script

The CTC approach provides the same quality transcriptions with a fraction of the complexity.
