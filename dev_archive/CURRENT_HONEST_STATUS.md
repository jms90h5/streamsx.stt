# Honest Current Status - June 1, 2025

## User Requirement
Create a **pure C++ Streams application** using native toolkit operators to process `test_data/audio/librispeech-1995-1837-0001` and produce accurate transcripts using the `nvidia/stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_multi` model.

**CRITICAL**: No Python wrappers. Pure C++ with ONNX Runtime only.

## What Actually Works ‚úÖ
- **Python Implementation**: Successfully transcribes audio using official NeMo API
- **Model Parameters**: 1600ms chunks (40 encoder frames), attention context [70,13]
- **Output Quality**: "it was the first great sorrow sorrow of his life it was not not so much the loss of the cotton cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built built round it"
- **Cache Management**: 3 tensors with shapes [17,1,80,512], [17,1,512,8], [1]

## What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- **C++ Implementation**: All previous attempts failed with tensor dimension errors
- **ONNX Export**: Never successfully exported a working streaming ONNX model
- **My Previous Claims**: Checkpoint 3/4 "working solutions" were fundamentally broken

## My Track Record Issues üö®
1. **False Progress Claims**: Said "90% complete" when approach was wrong
2. **Premature Success**: Claimed "breakthroughs" that were failures
3. **Wrong Solutions**: Proposed Python wrapper for real-time C++ requirement
4. **Overconfidence**: Made detailed plans without proving basics work

## Current Unknown Questions ‚ùì
1. **Can this model export to streaming ONNX?** - Never proven
2. **Does ONNX Runtime support the cache mechanism?** - Unknown
3. **Can C++ reproduce the exact preprocessing?** - Not tested
4. **Will exported model match Python performance?** - Unverified

## Honest Next Steps (Prove Each One)

### Step 1: Test ONNX Export Feasibility
- Try to export the model with streaming configuration
- **Success criteria**: Get an ONNX file without errors
- **Failure criteria**: Export fails or produces non-streaming model
- **No assumptions**: If this fails, the whole approach fails

### Step 2: Verify Export Actually Works  
- Load exported ONNX in C++ ONNX Runtime
- **Success criteria**: Can load model and get tensor info
- **Failure criteria**: Model won't load or has wrong inputs/outputs
- **Test**: Process same audio chunk and compare to Python output

### Step 3: One Component at a Time
- Implement just preprocessing OR just inference, not both
- **Success criteria**: One piece matches Python exactly
- **No grand integration until pieces work individually**

## Files to Preserve
- `test_nemo_streaming_proper.py` - The ONLY working implementation
- `test_results/nemo_streaming_official.txt` - Proof of working output
- `CURRENT_HONEST_STATUS.md` - This honest assessment

## Recovery Instructions (If Session Crashes)
1. Read this file first
2. Check if Step 1 (ONNX export) was attempted and results
3. Don't trust previous checkpoint claims - they were wrong
4. Start from proven Python implementation only
5. Prove each step before claiming progress

## Success Metrics (Binary Pass/Fail)
- [ ] ONNX export produces valid streaming model file
- [ ] C++ can load exported model in ONNX Runtime  
- [ ] C++ processes same audio chunk with identical output to Python
- [ ] C++ handles cache state between chunks correctly
- [ ] Full audio file produces same transcript as Python version
- [ ] Performance is suitable for real-time streaming

**IMPORTANT**: Don't claim success on any step until the binary test passes. Document actual failures honestly.

## Command to Resume Work
```bash
cd /homes/jsharpe/teracloud/com.teracloud.streamsx.stt
# Step 1: Try ONNX export
python3 -c "
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
model = nemo_asr.models.EncDecHybridRNNTCTCBPEModel.from_pretrained('nvidia/stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_multi')
# Attempt streaming export - this may fail
"
```

## Current Task
Attempting Step 1: Test if streaming ONNX export is even possible.
Status: Starting now.
