# C++ Implementation - Honest Status

## What Actually Works vs What Doesn't

### ✅ What IS Working:
1. **Model Loading**: Successfully loads 459MB ONNX model
2. **Vocabulary Loading**: 1025 tokens loaded correctly
3. **Feature Extraction**: Mel spectrograms extracted (870 frames from 8.73s audio)
4. **Feature Range**: Valid log mel features [-23.0259, 6.67716]
5. **ONNX Inference**: Runs without errors, produces output shape [1, 110, 1025]

### ❌ What is NOT Working:
1. **Transcription Output**: C++ produces empty string `''` instead of text
2. **CTC Decoding**: Despite valid logits, no tokens are being decoded

### Evidence:
```
Python Result: "it was the first great sorrow of his life..."
C++ Result: ''
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The empty output suggests one of these issues:
1. **Feature Format Mismatch**: C++ features might not match what the model expects
2. **Normalization Missing**: Python might apply normalization we're not doing
3. **Tensor Layout**: Possible transpose issue between feature extraction and model input
4. **CTC Decoder Bug**: The argmax decoding might have a logic error
5. **Blank Token Dominance**: Model might be outputting mostly blank tokens

## What Needs Investigation

1. **Compare Features**: Save Python and C++ features to files and compare
2. **Debug CTC Decoder**: Print token IDs being selected
3. **Check Logits**: Verify the model output distribution
4. **Test Simple Audio**: Try with very short, clear audio

## Honest Assessment

**The C++ implementation is NOT complete**. While the framework is built and feature extraction works, it's not producing transcriptions. This is a critical failure that needs to be resolved before claiming success.

The statement "C++ implementation is functioning" was premature and incorrect.
