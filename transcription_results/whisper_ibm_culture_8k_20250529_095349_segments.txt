============================================================

[   0.0s -    7.0s] We are standing together shoulder to shoulder, all working for one common good.
[   7.0s -   13.0s] And the good of each of us as individuals affects the greater good of the country.
[  13.0s -   16.0s] These words from our founder, Thomas J. Watson Sr.
[  16.0s -   20.0s] reflect IBM's past and our corporate character today.
[  20.0s -   24.0s] In 1899, we hired Richard McGregor, an African-American,
[  24.0s -   29.0s] 65 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
[  29.0s -   37.0s] In 1914, we hired our first disabled employee, 76 years before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
[  37.0s -   42.0s] In the 1930s, IBM continued its progressive workplace programs and policies
[  42.0s -   46.0s] with the arrival of professional women and equal pay for equal work
[  46.0s -   51.0s] and promoted its first female vice president, Ruth Leach-Amenet in 1943.
[  51.0s -   55.0s] Women's careers at IBM have been on the rise ever since.
[  55.0s -   63.0s] In 1953, Thomas J. Watson Jr. established a policy of hiring people without regard to race, color, or creed,
[  63.0s -   67.0s] making IBM the first US corporation to issue such a mandate.
[  67.0s -   76.0s] In the years that followed, this nondiscrimination policy was expanded to include religion, sex, gender, gender identity, or expression,
[  76.0s -   81.0s] sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, and age.
[  81.0s -   89.0s] And in 2005, IBM became the first major corporation in the world to include genetics' privacy in its nondiscrimination policies.
[  89.0s -   96.0s] We push forward every day, advocating for our employees to provide stability, reassurance, and support.
[  96.0s -  101.0s] Just as we publicly advocated against the bathroom bills in the United States,
[ 101.0s -  107.0s] so too have we set internal policies to extend same-sex partner benefits in 50 countries.
[ 107.0s -  111.0s] For more than 100 years, from our founders to Jenny Rometty today,
[ 111.0s -  115.0s] we believe that no one should face discrimination for being who they are.
[ 115.0s -  121.0s] We are privileged to work for a company that's had the opportunity to have an impact on history in so many ways.
[ 121.0s -  130.0s] IBM Earth speaks with a diverse voice, representing more than 170 countries, encouraging all of us to think.
[ 137.0s -  140.0s] Thank you.
